# How we use artificial intelligence

The technical writer oversees the integration of AI-driven tools and platforms into the documentation workflow, ensuring that AI-generated text meets the standards for clarity, coherence, and accuracy. While AI assists in tasks such as content generation, language enhancement, and formatting optimization, the technical writer is responsible for validating and refining the output to ensure its suitability for the intended audience.

Throughout the documentation process, the technical writer reviews the quality and relevance of AI-generated content in detail and with critical judgment. By leveraging their expertise in language, communication, and subject matter knowledge, the technical writer collaborates with AI systems to refine and tailor the documentation to meet the specific needs and preferences of the audience.

While AI accelerates the documentation process and enhances productivity, the technical writer verifies the information's accuracy and maintains consistency in terminology, style, and tone. The technical writer ensures that the final document reflects the company's commitment to excellence.
