    [Installing Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines)


## New Features


* [K8SPXC-394](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-394): Support of [“cluster-wide” mode](../cluster-wide.md) for Percona XtraDB Cluster Operator


* [K8SPXC-416](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-416): [Support of the proxy-protocol](../haproxy-conf.md#enabling-the-proxy-protocol) in HAProxy (to use this feature, you should have a Percona XtraDB Cluster image version `8.0.21` or newer)


* [K8SPXC-429](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-429): A possibility to [restore backups to a new Kubernetes-based environment](../backups-restore.md) with no existing Percona XtraDB Cluster Custom Resource


* [K8SPXC-343](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-343): Helm chart [officially provided with the Operator](../helm.md)

## Improvements


* [K8SPXC-144](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-144): Allow [adding ProxySQL configuration options](../proxysql-conf.md#passing-custom-configuration-options-to-proxysql)


* [K8SPXC-398](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-398): New `crVersion key` in `deploy/cr.yaml` to indicate the API version that the Custom Resource corresponds to (thanks to user mike.saah for contribution)


* [K8SPXC-474](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-474): The init container now has the same resource requests as the main container of a correspondent Pod (thanks to user yann.leenhardt for contribution)


* [K8SPXC-372](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-372): Support new versions of cert-manager by the Operator (thanks to user rf_enigm for contribution)


* [K8SPXC-317](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-317): Possibility to configure the `imagePullPolicy` Operator option (thanks to user imranrazakhan for contribution)


* [K8SPXC-462](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-462): Add readiness probe for HAProxy


* [K8SPXC-411](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-411): Extend cert-manager configuration to add additional domains (multiple SAN) to a certificate


* [K8SPXC-375](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-375): Improve HAProxy behavior in case of switching writer node to a new one and back


* [K8SPXC-368](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-368): Autoupdate system users by changing the appropriate Secret name

## Known Issues and Limitations


* OpenShift 3.11 requires additional configuration for the correct HAProxy operation:
the feature gate `PodShareProcessNamespace` should be set to `true`. If
getting it enabled is not possible, we recommend using ProxySQL instead of
HAProxy with OpenShift 3.11. Other OpenShift and Kubernetes versions are not affected.


* [K8SPXC-491](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-491): Compressed backups are not compatible with the Operator 1.6.0
(`percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:1.5.0-pxc8.0-backup` or
`percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:1.5.0-pxc5.7-backup` image can be
used as a workaround if needed).

## Bugs Fixed
