   [Installing Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines)

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spxcjira(1476) }}: Fix a bug where upgrade could put the cluster into a non-operational state if using Storage Classes without the Volume expansion capabilities, by introducing a new `enableVolumeExpansion` Custom Resource option toggling this functionality

## Deprecation, Change, Rename and Removal

* The new `enableVolumeExpansion` Custom Resource option allows to disable the [automated storage scaling with Volume Expansion capability](../scaling.md#automated-scaling-with-volume-expansion-capability). The default value of this option is `false`, which means that the automated scaling is turned off by default.

## Supported Platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with Percona XtraDB Cluster versions 8.0.36-28.1 and 5.7.44-31.65. Other options may also work but have not been tested. Other software components include:

* Percona XtraBackup versions 8.0.35-30.1 and 2.4.29-1
* HAProxy 2.8.5
* ProxySQL 2.5.5
