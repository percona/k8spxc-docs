# *Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster* 1.11.0


* **Date**

    June 3, 2022



* **Installation**

    [Installing Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines)


## Release Highlights


* With this release, the Operator turns to a simplified naming convention and changes its official name to **Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster**

* The new [backup.backoffLimit](../operator.md#backupbackofflimit) Custom Resource option allows customizing the number of attempts the Operator should make for backup

* The OpenAPI schema is now generated for the Operator, which allows Kubernetes to validate Custom Resource and protects users from occasionally applying `deploy/cr.yaml` with syntax errors

## New Features

* [K8SPXC-936](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-936): Allow modifying the init script via Custom Resource, which is useful for troubleshooting the Operator’s issues

* [K8SPXC-758](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-758): Allow to [skip TLS verification for backup storage](../operator.md#backupstoragesstorage-nameverifytls), useful for self-hosted S3-compatible storage with a self-signed certificate

## Improvements

* [K8SPXC-947](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-947): Parametrize the number of attempt the Operator should make for backup backup through a [Custom Resource option](../operator.md#backupbackofflimit)

* [K8SPXC-738](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-738): Allow to set service labels [for HAProxy](../operator.md#haproxyservicelabels) and [ProxySQL](../operator.md#proxysqlservicelabels) in Custom Resource to enable various integrations with cloud providers or service meshes

* [K8SPXC-848](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-848): PMM container does not cause the crash of the whole database Pod if pmm-agent is not working properly

* [K8SPXC-625](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-625): Print the total number of binlogs and the number of remaining binlogs in the restore log while point-in-time recovery in progress

* [K8SPXC-920](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-920): Using the new [Percona XtraBackup Exponential Backoff feature :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-xtrabackup/8.0/xbcloud/xbcloud_exbackoff.html) decreases the number of occasional unsuccessful backups due to more effective retries timing (Thanks to Dustin Falgout for reporting this issue)

* [K8SPXC-823](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-823): Make it possible [to use API Key](../monitoring.md#operator-monitoring-client-token) to authorize within Percona Monitoring and Management Server

* [K8SPXC-957](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-957): Fix a bug due to which `pxc-db` Helm chart didn’t support setting the `replicasServiceType` Custom Resource option (Thanks to Carlos Martell for reporting this issue)

* [K8SPXC-534](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-534): Fix a bug that caused some SQL queries to fail during the pxc StatefulSet update (Thanks to Sergiy Prykhodko for reporting this issue)

* [K8SPXC-961](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-961): Fix a bug due to which a user-defined sidecar container image in the Operator Pod could be treated as the initImage (Thanks to Carlos Martell for reporting this issue)

* [K8SPXC-862](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-862): Fix a bug due to which changing resources as integer values without quotes in Custom Resource could lead to cluster getting stuck

* [K8SPXC-814](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-814): Fix a bug when Custom Resource status was missing due to invalid variable setting in the manifest

## Deprecation, Rename and Removal

* [K8SPXC-823](https://jira.percona.com/browse/K8SPXC-823):  Password-based authorization to Percona Monitoring and Management Server is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases in favor of a token-based one. Password-based authorization was used by the Operator before this release to provide MySQL monitoring, but now using the API Key [is the recommended authorization method](../monitoring.md#operator-monitoring-client-token)

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
1.11.0:

* [OpenShift :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.7 - 4.10

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.20 - 1.23

* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.20 - 1.22

* [Minikube :octicons-link-external-16:](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) 1.23

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
