# *Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster* 1.3.0

Percona announces the *Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster*
1.3.0 release on January 6, 2020. This release is now the current GA release
in the 1.3 series. [Install the Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster
by following the instructions](../kubernetes.md).

The Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster automates the
lifecycle and provides a consistent Percona XtraDB Cluster instance. The
Operator can be used to create a Percona XtraDB Cluster, or scale an existing
Cluster and contains the necessary Kubernetes settings.

The Operator simplifies the deployment and management of the [Percona XtraDB
Cluster :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtradb-cluster)
in Kubernetes-based environments. It extends the Kubernetes API with a new
custom resource for deploying, configuring and managing the application through
the whole life cycle.

The Operator source code is available [in our Github repository :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator).
All of Percona’s software is open-source and free.

**New features and improvements:**


* [CLOUD-412](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-412): Auto-Tuning of the MySQL Parameters based on Pod memory
resources was implemented in the case of Percona XtraDB Cluster Pod limits
(or at least Pod requests) specified in the cr.yaml file.


* [CLOUD-411](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-411): Now the user can adjust securityContext, replacing
the automatically generated securityContext with the customized one.


* [CLOUD-394](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-394): The Percona XtraDB Cluster, ProxySQL, and backup images size
decrease by 40-60% was achieved by removing unnecessary dependencies and
modules to reduce the cluster deployment time.


* [CLOUD-390](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-390): Helm chart for Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) 2.0
has been provided.


* [CLOUD-383](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-383): Affinity constraints and tolerations were added to the
backup Pod


* [CLOUD-430](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-430): Image URL in the CronJob Pod template is automatically
updated when the Operator detects changed backup image URL

**Fixed bugs:**


* [CLOUD-462](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-462): Resource requests/limits were set not for all containers
in a ProxySQL Pod


* [CLOUD-437](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-437): Percona Monitoring and Management Client was taking
resources definition from the Percona XtraDB Cluster despite having much lower
need in resources, particularly lower memory footprint.


* [CLOUD-434](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-434): Restoring Percona XtraDB Cluster was failing on the
OpenShift platform with customized security settings


* [CLOUD-399](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-399): The iputils package was added to the backup docker image to
provide backup jobs with the ping command for a better network connection
handling


* [CLOUD-393](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-393): The Operator generated various StatefulSets in the first
reconciliation cycle and in all subsequent reconciliation cycles, causing
Kubernetes to trigger an unnecessary ProxySQL restart once during the cluster
creation.


* [CLOUD-376](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-376): A long-running SST caused the liveness probe check to fail
it’s grace period timeout, resulting in an unrecoverable failure


* [CLOUD-243](https://jira.percona.com/browse/CLOUD-243): Using MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD with special characters in a
ProxySQL docker image was breaking the entrypoint initialization process
