   [Installing Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines)

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spxcjira(1536) }}: Fix a bug where scheduled backups were not working due to a bug in the Operator that was creating Kubernetes resources with the names exceeding the allowed length (Thanks to Vlad Gusev for contribution)

## Supported Platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with Percona XtraDB Cluster versions 8.4.2-2.1 (Tech preview), 8.0.39-30.1, and 5.7.44-31.65. Other options may also work but have not been tested. Other software components include:

* Percona XtraBackup versions 8.4.0-1, 8.0.35-30.1 and 2.4.29
* HAProxy 2.8.11
* ProxySQL 2.7.1
* LogCollector based on fluent-bit 3.2.2
* PMM Client 2.44.0

Percona Operators are designed for compatibility with all [CNCF-certified :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) Kubernetes distributions. Our release process includes targeted testing and validation on major cloud provider platforms and OpenShift, as detailed below for Operator version 1.16.1:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.28 - 1.30
* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.28 - 1.31
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) 1.28 - 1.31
* [OpenShift :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.14.42 - 4.17.8
* [Minikube :octicons-link-external-16:](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) 1.34.0 based on Kubernetes 1.31.0

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
