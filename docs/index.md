# Percona Operator for MySQL Based on Percona XtraDB Cluster  

The **[Percona Operator for MySQL :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator)** is a Kubernetes-native solution designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of MySQL clusters built on Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC). The Operator leverages Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities to automate critical database management tasks, including cluster provisioning, backups, failover, and scaling.

**[Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtradb-cluster)** is an open-source, enterprise-grade MySQL solution designed for high availability and data consistency. It uses synchronous replication to ensure that data is consistent across all nodes in the cluster. PXC provides fault tolerance, automated failover, and scalability, making it ideal for running highly available MySQL databases in mission-critical environments.

This provides the foundation for the Percona Operator for MySQL, enabling simplified deployment and management of Percona XtraDB Cluster within Kubernetes environments.
