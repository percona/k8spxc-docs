We recommend to monitor the database with
[Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/3/index.html)
integrated within the Operator. You can also use [custom monitoring solutions](monitoring.md#implement-custom-monitoring-solution-without-pmm), but their deployment is not automated by the Operator and requires manual setup).

In this section you will learn how to monitor Percona XtraDB Cluster with PMM.

PMM is a client/server application. It consists of the [PMM Server :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/3/details/architecture.html#pmm-server) and a number of [PMM Clients :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/3/details/architecture.html#pmm-client). PMM Clients run on each node with the database you wish to monitor. In Kubernetes, this means that PMM Clients run as sidecar containers for the database Pods.

A PMM Client collects needed metrics and sends the gathered data to the PMM Server.
 As a user, you connect to the PMM Server to see database metrics on
a number of dashboards.

PMM Server and PMM Client are installed separately.

## Install PMM Server

You must have PMM server up and running. You can run PMM Server as a *Docker image*, a *virtual appliance*, or on an *AWS instance*.
Please refer to the [official PMM documentation :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/2/setting-up/server/index.html)
for the installation instructions.

## Install PMM Client

Install PMM Client as a side-car container in your Kubernetes-based environment:
{.power-number}

1. Authorize PMM Client within PMM Server. 

    === "Token-based authorization (recommended)"

        <a name="operator-monitoring-client-token"></a>
        1. [Generate the PMM Server API Key :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/2/details/api.html#api-keys-and-authentication). Specify the Admin role when getting the API Key. 

        <i warning>:material-alert: Warning:</i> The API key is not rotated automatically.

        2. Edit the [deploy/secrets.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/secrets.yaml) secrets file and specify the PMM API key for the `pmmserverkey` option.
        3. Apply the configuration for the changes to take effect.

            ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
            $ kubectl apply -f deploy/secrets.yaml -n <namespace>
            ```
    
    === "Password-based authorization (deprecated since the Operator 1.11.0)"

        1. Check that  the `serverUser` key in the
            [deploy/cr.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml)
            file contains your PMM Server user name (`admin` by default), and
            make sure the `pmmserver` key in the
            [deploy/secrets.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/secrets.yaml)
            secrets file contains the password specified for the PMM Server during
            its installation

        2. Apply the configuration for the changes to take effect.

            ``` {.bash data-prompt="$"}
            $ kubectl apply -f deploy/secrets.yaml -n <namespace>
            ```

2. Update the `pmm` section in the [deploy/cr.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml) file:

    * Set `pmm.enabled`=`true`.
    * Specify your PMM Server hostname / an IP address for the `pmm.serverHost` option. The PMM Server IP address should be resolvable and reachable from within your cluster.

     ```yaml
       pmm:
         enabled: true
         image: percona/pmm-client:{{pmm2recommended}}
         serverHost: monitoring-service
     ``` 

3. Apply the changes:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```

4. Check that corresponding Pods are not in a cycle of stopping and restarting.
    This cycle occurs if there are errors on the previous steps:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
    $ kubectl logs  <cluster-name>-pxc-0 -c pmm-client -n <namespace>
    ```

## Check the metrics

Let's see how the collected data is visualized in PMM.

Now you can access PMM via *https* in a web browser, with the login/password
authentication, and the browser is configured to show Percona XtraDB Cluster
metrics.
