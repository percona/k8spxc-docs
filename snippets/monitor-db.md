# Monitor database with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)

The recommended way of the database monitoring is to use
[Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html)
integrated within the Operator (while custom monitoring solutions [are also possible :octicons-link-external-16:](monitoring.md#implement-custom-monitoring-solution-without-pmm), their deployment is not automated by the Operator and requires manual set up).
In this section you will learn how to monitor Percona XtraDB Cluster with PMM.

!!! note

    Only PMM 2.x versions are supported by the Operator.

PMM is a client/server application. It includes the [PMM Server :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/architecture.html#pmm-server) and the number of [PMM Clients :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/architecture.html#pmm-client) running on each node with the database you wish to monitor.

A PMM Client collects needed metrics and sends gathered data to the PMM Server.
 As a user, you connect to the PMM Server to see database metrics on
a number of dashboards.

PMM Server and PMM Client are installed separately.

## Install PMM Server

You must have PMM server up and running. You can run PMM Server as a *Docker image*, a *virtual appliance*, or on an *AWS instance*.
Please refer to the [official PMM documentation :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/index.html)
for the installation instructions.

## Install PMM Client

To install PMM Client as a side-car container in your Kubernetes-based environment, do the following:
{.power-number}

1. Authorize PMM Client within PMM Server. 

    === "Token-based authorization (recommended)"

        <a name="operator-monitoring-client-token"></a>
        1. [Generate the PMM Server API Key :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/api.html#api-keys-and-authentication). Specify the Admin role when getting the API Key. 

        <i warning>:material-alert: Warning:</i> The API key is not rotated automatically.

        2. Edit the [deploy/secrets.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/secrets.yaml) secrets file and specify the PMM API key for the `pmmserverkey` option.
        3. Apply the configuration for the changes to take effect.

            ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
            $ kubectl apply -f deploy/secrets.yaml -n <namespace>
            ```
    
    === "Password-based authorization (deprecated since the Operator 1.11.0)"

        1. Check that  the `serverUser` key in the
            [deploy/cr.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml)
            file contains your PMM Server user name (`admin` by default), and
            make sure the `pmmserver` key in the
            [deploy/secrets.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/secrets.yaml)
            secrets file contains the password specified for the PMM Server during
            its installation

        2. Apply the configuration for the changes to take effect.

            ``` {.bash data-prompt="$"}
            $ kubectl apply -f deploy/secrets.yaml -n <namespace>
            ```

2. Update the `pmm` section in the [deploy/cr.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml) file:

    * Set `pmm.enabled`=`true`.
    * Specify your PMM Server hostname / an IP address for the `pmm.serverHost` option. The PMM Server IP address should be resolvable and reachable from within your cluster.

     ```yaml
       pmm:
         enabled: true
         image: percona/pmm-client:{{pmm2recommended}}
         serverHost: monitoring-service
     ``` 
3. Apply the changes:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```

4. Check that corresponding Pods are not in a cycle of stopping and restarting.
    This cycle occurs if there are errors on the previous steps:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
    $ kubectl logs  <cluster-name>-pxc-0 -c pmm-client -n <namespace>
    ```

## Check the metrics

Let's see how the collected data is visualized in PMM.

Now you can access PMM via *https* in a web browser, with the login/password
authentication, and the browser is configured to show Percona XtraDB Cluster
metrics.
